# Changelog

All notable changes to the Archivist Sync module will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.11] - 2025-01-15

### Fixed
- When syncing existing Session Recaps via the "Sync with Archivist" button, the `sessionDate` flag is now properly detected and updated when the `session_date` changes in Archivist, ensuring correct date display and chronological sorting in the Recaps folder.

## [1.3.10] - 2025-01-15

### Fixed
- Custom elements (sync button, create buttons, eye toggle buttons) in the Journals tab now mount immediately after world setup completes, without requiring a manual refresh. Fixed V13 ApplicationV2 element access and added automatic re-render triggers when world initialization completes.
- Improved robustness of Journal Directory hooks with retry mechanisms to handle asynchronous DOM rendering.

### Changed
- Recap custom sheet now displays the session date as MM/DD/YYYY.
- After importing Recaps via the Sync dialog, Recaps in the Recaps folder are normalized to sort by the `sessionDate` flag ascending (oldest → newest); undated Recaps are placed at the end.

## [1.3.9] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed
- Recap “lock” (save) action could wipe the summary in Foundry and on the Archivist API if the editor selector failed to resolve; editor detection has been made robust for the Recap layout, local page updates only occur when content is actually read, and the API summary field is only included when content is present.

## [1.3.7] - 2025-12-05

### Fixed
- Realtime sync hooks now ignore core Foundry documents and third-party imports unless they carry Archivist flags, preventing conflicts with modules like PopOut and stopping unintended API POSTs for unrelated items/journals.

### Changed
- World Setup and manual Sync dialogs now start with no rows selected so GMs must explicitly opt in to each import/diff, preventing accidental bulk operations.

## [1.3.6] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- CoC7 conflict with roll result chat card

## [1.3.5] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed
- Token duplication when drag and dropping.
- Adjustments to the sync 

## [1.3.4] - 2025-10-21

### Changed
- Recaps Journal folder entries are now sorted chronologically

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- If the counts for documents being imported into Archivist during the initial world setup exceed 100 for any of the categories, we format those values in red and display a conditional warning to users not to import generic compendium items into their Archivist campaigns.

### Changed
- Moved visibility toggle icon buttons to in-line actions for list items in Journals tab
- Replaced "Archivist Hub" button in Journals tab with "Sync with Archivist" button
- We no longer overwrite the `img` property of existing Actors/Items if they are mapped to an Archivist record during initial sync. We'll only set that property if we're creating a new object for the user and we have a non-null Archivist `image` value.

### Removed
- Archivist Hub Dialog
- Archivist Hub Scene controls button
- Archivist Hub buttons in Journal tab and Archivist chat tab

### Fixed
- Updating descriptions through Archivist sync now used proper html formatting so the html renders correctly in the Info tab
- Using "Place on Scene" button for Actors only fires once

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- New "Chat Visibility" setting allows GMs to control who can see the Archivist Chat sidebar tab (All users, GM only, or None)

### Changed
- "Run World Setup Again" now completely clears Archivist journal directories

### Fixed
